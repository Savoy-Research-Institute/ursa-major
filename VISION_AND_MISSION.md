## ðŸ”‘ Founder's Intent (Internal Only)

"I want to build systems that make drones not only usefulâ€”but **necessary**. Necessary for health, commerce, and defense.

The goal is clear: **build the standard** that others have to follow, and in doing so, make the tools that secure my future while reshaping the world."
